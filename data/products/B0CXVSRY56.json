        "body": "I've tried just about every name brand laptop in this category (gaming laptops) and this was the only one (Alienware) that I did not try. The reason I didn't try was because of all the not-so-great reviews and how the cons were just simply not 'acceptable' for 2024. After much trial and tribulation, I figured I had nothing left to lose except to not try this brand. Well low and behold! This laptop was PERFECT for me! I wanted a portable AND capable Beast and this fit the bill PERFECTLY! It maybe a little chunky for people who don't eat meat or work out, but for me it was a very acceptable compromise for what I was looking for in a laptop (a consistent gaming experience whether at home or abroad). It plays all my games at max settings without any problems at all. Others I've had always ended up throttling themselves (despite being 'higher spec'd' than this one) and either stuttered or over-heated to the point it would lock up or shut down. This laptop might get a little 'loud' but it never over heats, never shuts down, and to my surprise, never throttled, not even once. I bought a laptop backpack for this laptop here in Amazon (just look up backpacks for 18.4\" laptops). It works PERFECTLY for my needs. Tech Support is practically built right into this machine too. Most questions I had about anything was easily found with the included software packages. I have no regrets with this purchase and can easily recommend this to people who want a great laptop and a Beast without all the marketing and fluff (and failures) of the other 'Top Tier' or 'Higher Spec'd' laptops out there (looking at you ASUS and LENOVO). Oh wait, I do have one regret, and it's that I didn't get this sooner and let my own bias and the bias of other laptop 'Professional Reviewers' sway me away from this brand early on during my searches for the PERFECT laptop for ME.

The reason I didn&apos;t try was because of all the not-so-great reviews and how the cons were just simply not &apos;acceptable&apos; for 2024. After much trial and tribulation, I figured I had nothing left to lose except to not try this brand. Well low and behold! This laptop was PERFECT for me! I wanted a portable AND capable Beast and this fit the bill PERFECTLY! It maybe a little chunky for people who don&apos;t eat meat or work out, but for me it was a very acceptable compromise for what I was looking for in a laptop (a consistent gaming experience whether at home or abroad). It plays all my games at max settings without any problems at all. Others I&apos;ve had always ended up throttling themselves (despite being &apos;higher spec&apos;d&apos; than this one) and either stuttered or over-heated to the point it would lock up or shut down. This laptop might get a little &apos;loud&apos; but it never over heats, never shuts down, and to my surprise, never throttled, not even once. I bought a laptop backpack for this laptop here in Amazon (just look up backpacks for 18.4&quot; laptops). It works PERFECTLY for my needs. Tech Support is practically built right into this machine too. Most questions I had about anything was easily found with the included software packages. I have no regrets with this purchase and can easily recommend this to people who want a great laptop and a Beast without all the marketing and fluff (and failures) of the other &apos;Top Tier&apos; or &apos;Higher Spec&apos;d&apos; laptops out there (looking at you ASUS and LENOVO). Oh wait, I do have one regret, and it&apos;s that I didn&apos;t get this sooner and let my own bias and the bias of other laptop &apos;Professional Reviewers&apos; sway me away from this brand early on during my searches for the PERFECT laptop for ME.<br/></span>   </div><div class=\"a-expander-header a-expander-partial-collapse-header\"><div class=\"a-expander-content-fade\"/><a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" data-hook=\"expand-collapse-read-more-less\" aria-label=\"Read more of this review\" aria-expanded=\"false\" role=\"button\" data-action=\"a-expander-toggle\" class=\"a-declarative\" data-a-expander-toggle=\"{&quot;allowLinkDefault&quot;:true, &quot;expand_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read more&quot;, &quot;collapse_prompt&quot;:&quot;Read less&quot;}\"><i class=\"a-icon a-icon-extender-expand\"/><span class=\"a-expander-prompt\">Read more</span></a></div></div>",
