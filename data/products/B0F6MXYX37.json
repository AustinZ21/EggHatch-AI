I’m now paying off a loan on a computer that can’t handle CAPCUT OR DOWNLOADING DRIVERS(?!) like is this real?! The laptop was fine at the beginning, it would do a random restart once or twice everyone once in a while. It now can’t do simple things without the fans sounding like a jet engine and it restarting itself. This is so absolutely frustrating on so many levels I legitimately cannot express it over text. $1,000 dollars for a computer that struggles with downloading stuff off the internet, how useful. I’m trying to fix it and I’ll update if I can fix it. I wish I could get a refund. I don’t know if I could because it’s “modified” I guess. My HP Pavilion that was $500 and several years old handles better than this computer. If you have bad luck, go get a computer from a trusted source without any modifications or you’ll be throwing your broke self into more debt for a useless piece of garbage. I use it SOLELY for video editing, there is literally nothing else on this computer. I have CapCut and the media needed for video editing. THAT’S IT and yet the computer can’t deliver what I want. I’m so disappointed. Since I’m already broke because $1,000 dollars isn’t just /something I have/ I can’t afford to go get it looked at and I’m stupid so of course I’m not gonna understand anything. I buy stuff so that it’s done for me because it’s not my level of expertise. Like said I’ll update when or IF I get justice. Like it working or a refund or something, but with the way things are going I’m thinking nothing is gonna happen and this will be just another experience to throw into the pile of things I cry myself to sleep thinking about.  EDIT 9/5/23 Still having trouble but recently had a breakthrough!!! So I bought fans for the laptop, surprise!! didn’t work and it still kept rebooting on me randomly so I just set it under my bed to rot before I would break it over my knee. So it sat there for a while and randomly a few nights ago I was telling my friend about it and I pulled it out and it was working completely fine, like, not a single problem at all and I was like this laptop is trying to make me look bad wtf. I was amazed though and so happy. So I pulled it out today to use it and still no problems, but then the battery got low so I plugged it in and there it goes rebooting. IT WAS IT BEING PLUGGED INTO THE CHARGER?!!?? I tested it a few times then and every-time without fail the MOMENT i would put that bad boy charger in the rebooting parade would commence. My laptop came with a fault that has something to do with the charger and power and stuff because it would reboot randomly at the very beginning and then it got worse overtime. So now that I have discovered that there is hope I will be going and getting it checked out in hopes of it being a cheap fix. I will be keeping the one star though because in the end it came to me broken and has caused me more grief than I would like to admit and my opinion of it being a gamble still stands as other people have also had theirs arrive broken and stuff. TLDR; It’s a good laptop but don’t take the risk of it showing up broken, it’s NOT worth it. Read more",
