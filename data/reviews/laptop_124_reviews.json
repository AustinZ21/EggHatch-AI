    "text": "Absolutely love this laptop! The performance for competitive gaming is incredible, especially the NVIDIA GTX 1070. Boots up super fast and handles everything I throw at it. The keyboard is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the Alienware 17 R5 AW17R5-7092SLV 17.3\" IPS Intel Core i7 8th Gen 8750H (2.20 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 16 GB Memory 8 GB SSD 1 TB SSHD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop!",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Fortnite, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Alienware 17 R5 AW17R5-7092SLV 17.3\" IPS Intel Core i7 8th Gen 8750H (2.20 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 16 GB Memory 8 GB SSD 1 TB SSHD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The speakers is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the Alienware 17 R5 AW17R5-7092SLV 17.3\" IPS Intel Core i7 8th Gen 8750H (2.20 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 16 GB Memory 8 GB SSD 1 TB SSHD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It overheats frequently when playing Starfield, and the performance throttles significantly. The trackpad has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
