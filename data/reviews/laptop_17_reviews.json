    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS ROG STRIX Scar Edition 120 Hz Display GL503VD-EB72 15.6\" Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7-7700HQ Processor (up to 3.8 GHz), GTX 1050 4 GB, 8 GB DDR4, 128 GB PCIEG3x4 NVMe SSD + 1 TB Hybrid Drive. The keyboard is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
