The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The chassis feels surprisingly flimsy for the price.. Looking to return it.",

Wi-Fi drops intermittently and the keyboard feels cheap. Performance in content creation and gaming is not as advertised. Regret this purchase.",

It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Starfield, and the performance throttles significantly. The keyboard has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
