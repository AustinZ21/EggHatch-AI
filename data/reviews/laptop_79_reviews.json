The NVIDIA GTX 1660 is good, but I expected a bit more from the build material on the ASUS GA502DU-PB73 15.6\" 60 Hz IPS AMD Ryzen 7 2nd Gen 3750H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 8 GB Memory 512 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS GA502DU-PB73 15.6\" 60 Hz IPS AMD Ryzen 7 2nd Gen 3750H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 8 GB Memory 512 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1660 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Battery drains incredibly fast, even on light tasks.. Looking to return it.",

Good for gaming, but the keyboard could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
