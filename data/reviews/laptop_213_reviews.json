The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Battery drains incredibly fast, even on light tasks.. Looking to return it.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is good, but I expected a bit more from the screen brightness on the Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-73S0 15.6\" 144 Hz IPS, Intel Core i7 8750H (2.20 GHz), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060, 16 GB Memory, 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD, Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
