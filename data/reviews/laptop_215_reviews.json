The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is good, but I expected a bit more from the screen brightness on the HIDevolution ASUS Zephyrus M GM501GM 15.6” FHD 144Hz, 2.2 GHz i7-8750H, GTX 1060, 16GB DDR4/2666MHz RAM, PCIe 256GB SSD + 1TB SSHD, Authorized Performance Upgrades & Warranty.

The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",

Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the HIDevolution ASUS Zephyrus M GM501GM 15.6” FHD 144Hz, 2.2 GHz i7-8750H, GTX 1060, 16GB DDR4/2666MHz RAM, PCIe 256GB SSD + 1TB SSHD, Authorized Performance Upgrades & Warranty. The keyboard is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Cyberpunk 2077, and the performance throttles significantly. The trackpad has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
