    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Apex Legends, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the The Razer Blade GeForce GTX 1060 VR Ready, 14\" HD Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7 7th Gen i7 7700HQ (2.80GHz), 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD. The build material is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is good, but I expected a bit more from the battery life on the The Razer Blade GeForce GTX 1060 VR Ready, 14\" HD Gaming Laptop, Intel Core i7 7th Gen i7 7700HQ (2.80GHz), 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
