Performance is good for most games like Apex Legends, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Newest Acer Nitro 5 15.6\" FHD Premium Gaming Laptop, Intel Quad Core i5-8300H upto 4.0GHz, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5, Backlit Keyboard, Windows 10. The screen brightness is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the screen brightness on the Newest Acer Nitro 5 15.6\" FHD Premium Gaming Laptop, Intel Quad Core i5-8300H upto 4.0GHz, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB GDDR5, Backlit Keyboard, Windows 10. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
