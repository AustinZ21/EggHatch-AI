The NVIDIA GTX 1660 is good, but I expected a bit more from the fan noise on the ASUS TUF Gaming Laptop, 15.6\" Full HD IPS-Type, AMD Ryzen 5 R5-3550H, GeForce GTX 1660 Ti, 8 GB DDR4, 512 GB PCIe SSD, Gigabit Wi-Fi 5, Windows 10 Home, FX505DU-MB53. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
