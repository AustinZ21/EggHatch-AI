Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the GIGABYTE AERO 15S OLED SA-7US5130SH 15.6\" 4K AMOLED 60 Hz Intel Core i7 9th Gen 9750H (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 16 GB Memory 512 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop.

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1660 is good, but I expected a bit more from the fan noise on the GIGABYTE AERO 15S OLED SA-7US5130SH 15.6\" 4K AMOLED 60 Hz Intel Core i7 9th Gen 9750H (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660 Ti 16 GB Memory 512 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
