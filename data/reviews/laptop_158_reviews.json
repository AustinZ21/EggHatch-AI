    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Aspire 7 Premium 17.3\" Gaming and Bussiness Laptop (Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake i7-8750H 6-core, 16GB RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, 17.3\" FHD ( 1920x1080 ), GeForce GTX 1060, Win 10 Home) VR Ready. The keyboard is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is good, but I expected a bit more from the speakers on the Acer Aspire 7 Premium 17.3\" Gaming and Bussiness Laptop (Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake i7-8750H 6-core, 16GB RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, 17.3\" FHD ( 1920x1080 ), GeForce GTX 1060, Win 10 Home) VR Ready. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

    "text": "Avoid the Acer Aspire 7 Premium 17.3\" Gaming and Bussiness Laptop (Intel 8th Gen Coffee Lake i7-8750H 6-core, 16GB RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, 17.3\" FHD ( 1920x1080 ), GeForce GTX 1060, Win 10 Home) VR Ready if you can. The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The chassis feels surprisingly flimsy for the price.. Looking to return it.",

Good for AAA gaming, but the port selection could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
