It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Apex Legends, and the performance throttles significantly. The screen brightness has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

Good for gaming, but the fan noise could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS VivoBook R510IK-LHFX 15.6\" AMD FX-Series FX-9830P (3.0 GHz) AMD Radeon RX 560 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The build material is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
