    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Elden Ring, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS ROG Zephyrus GX501 (8th-Gen) 15.6\" Ultra Slim Gaming Laptop, 144 Hz IPS-Type G-SYNC Panel, GTX 1080 8 GB, Intel Core i7-8750H Processor (up to 3.9 GHz), 512 GB PCIe SSD, 16 GB DDR4 2666 MHz. The battery life is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1080 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",
