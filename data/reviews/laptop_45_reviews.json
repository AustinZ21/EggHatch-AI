Performance is good for most games like Starfield, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the MSI PL62 7RC-001 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce MX150 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The battery life is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The Intel Core i7 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Battery drains incredibly fast, even on light tasks.. Looking to return it.",

The Intel Core i7 is good, but I expected a bit more from the battery life on the MSI PL62 7RC-001 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce MX150 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Apex Legends, and the performance throttles significantly. The fan noise has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
