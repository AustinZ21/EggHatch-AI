Good for AAA gaming, but the build material could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Elden Ring, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS GL503VM-IH73 15.6\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 16 GB Memory 128 GB M.2 SATA SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The speakers is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
