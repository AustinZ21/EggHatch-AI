Wi-Fi drops intermittently and the keyboard feels cheap. Performance in AAA gaming is not as advertised. Regret this purchase.",

Performance is good for most games like Fortnite, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the DELL G3579-5467BLK-PUS 15.6\" Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 8 GB Memory 1 TB SSHD (8 GB Cache) Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the battery life on the DELL G3579-5467BLK-PUS 15.6\" Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 8 GB Memory 1 TB SSHD (8 GB Cache) Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
