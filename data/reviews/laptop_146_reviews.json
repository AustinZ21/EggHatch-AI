Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the HP Pavilion Gaming 15-cx0020nr 15.6\" FHD IPS GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB VRAM i5-8300H 8 GB Memory 16 GB Optane Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the screen brightness on the HP Pavilion Gaming 15-cx0020nr 15.6\" FHD IPS GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB VRAM i5-8300H 8 GB Memory 16 GB Optane Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Good for gaming, but the battery life could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
