    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Elden Ring, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-52-72EV 15.6\" 144 Hz IPS Intel Core i7 9th Gen 9750H (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 16 GB Memory 512 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
