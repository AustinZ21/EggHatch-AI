    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Cyberpunk 2077, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the MSI GP63 Leopard-013 Gaming Laptop GTX 1060 6 GB i7-8750H  15.6\" Windows 10 Home 64-bit. The speakers is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
