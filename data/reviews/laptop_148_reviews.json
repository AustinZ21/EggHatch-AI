    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53-762Q 15.6\" IPS FHD, Intel Core i7 8750H (2.20 GHz), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050, 8 GB DDR4 Memory, 1 TB HDD, Windows 10 Home. It overheats frequently when playing Fortnite, and the performance throttles significantly. The keyboard has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

The screen brightness is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53-762Q 15.6\" IPS FHD, Intel Core i7 8750H (2.20 GHz), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050, 8 GB DDR4 Memory, 1 TB HDD, Windows 10 Home!",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Starfield, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53-762Q 15.6\" IPS FHD, Intel Core i7 8750H (2.20 GHz), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050, 8 GB DDR4 Memory, 1 TB HDD, Windows 10 Home. The build material is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the port selection on the Acer Nitro 5 AN515-53-762Q 15.6\" IPS FHD, Intel Core i7 8750H (2.20 GHz), NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050, 8 GB DDR4 Memory, 1 TB HDD, Windows 10 Home. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
