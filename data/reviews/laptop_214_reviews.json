The NVIDIA GTX 1650 is good, but I expected a bit more from the keyboard on the MSI GF63 9SC-060CA Thin 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i5 9th Gen 9300H (2.40 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop.

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Starfield, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the MSI GF63 9SC-060CA Thin 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i5 9th Gen 9300H (2.40 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The port selection is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
