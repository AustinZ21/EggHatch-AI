The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",

Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS TUF Gaming FX504GD-RS51 15.6\" Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 8 GB Memory 1 TB FireCuda SSHD (8 GB SSD Cache) Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The speakers is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the ASUS TUF Gaming FX504GD-RS51 15.6\" Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 8 GB Memory 1 TB FireCuda SSHD (8 GB SSD Cache) Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It blue screens occasionally frequently when playing Cyberpunk 2077, and the performance throttles significantly. The battery life has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
