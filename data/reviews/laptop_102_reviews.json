The NVIDIA GTX 960 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The chassis feels surprisingly flimsy for the price.. Looking to return it.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the HP Pavilion 15t Touch Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad Core Windows 10 Home 4GB GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 15.6” Full HD IPS Touchscreen Display 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD 16GB DDR4 RAM. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 960 is good, but I expected a bit more from the port selection on the HP Pavilion 15t Touch Gaming Laptop - Intel Core i7-6700HQ Quad Core Windows 10 Home 4GB GDDR5 NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M 15.6” Full HD IPS Touchscreen Display 256GB PCIe NVMe SSD 16GB DDR4 RAM. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Good for streaming games, but the keyboard could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
