    "text": "Absolutely love this laptop! The performance for streaming games is incredible, especially the NVIDIA GTX 1070. Boots up super fast and handles everything I throw at it. The fan noise is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the Open Box: ASUS ROG Strix SCAR II GL504GS-DH76, 15.6\" 144 Hz 3 ms IPS Slim Bezel Display, GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB, Intel Core i7-8750H (up to 3.9 GHz), 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, 16 GB DDR4, RGB Keyboard!",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Open Box: ASUS ROG Strix SCAR II GL504GS-DH76, 15.6\" 144 Hz 3 ms IPS Slim Bezel Display, GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB, Intel Core i7-8750H (up to 3.9 GHz), 512 GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, 16 GB DDR4, RGB Keyboard. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Good for gaming, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
