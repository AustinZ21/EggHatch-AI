Performance is good for most games like Fortnite, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Predator 17 G9-793-79V5 Gaming Laptop Intel Core i7-7700HQ , GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3\" Full HD G-SYNC, 16 GB DDR4, 1 TB HDD, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 Home. The trackpad is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Good for content creation and gaming, but the battery life could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1070 is good, but I expected a bit more from the trackpad on the Acer Predator 17 G9-793-79V5 Gaming Laptop Intel Core i7-7700HQ , GeForce GTX 1070, 17.3\" Full HD G-SYNC, 16 GB DDR4, 1 TB HDD, 256 GB SSD, Windows 10 Home. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
