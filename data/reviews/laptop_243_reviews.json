The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the speakers on the 2019 Newest Dell 15.6\" FHD IPS High-Performance Gaming Laptop | Intel Core i5-8300H Quad-Core | 8GB+1TB HDD | GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4GB | Backlit Keyboard | Windows 10. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Good for AAA gaming, but the speakers could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

It Wi-Fi drops intermittently frequently when playing Valorant, and the performance throttles significantly. The fan noise has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
