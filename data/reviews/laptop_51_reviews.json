    "text": "Absolutely love this laptop! The performance for content creation and gaming is incredible, especially the NVIDIA GTX 860. Boots up super fast and handles everything I throw at it. The speakers is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the Refurbished: ASUS ROG GL551 series GL551JM-DH71 15.6\" Intel Core i7 4th Gen 4710HQ (2.50 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 16 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Gaming Laptop!",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Cyberpunk 2077, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Refurbished: ASUS ROG GL551 series GL551JM-DH71 15.6\" Intel Core i7 4th Gen 4710HQ (2.50 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 16 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The screen brightness is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the Refurbished: ASUS ROG GL551 series GL551JM-DH71 15.6\" Intel Core i7 4th Gen 4710HQ (2.50 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 16 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It blue screens occasionally frequently when playing Cyberpunk 2077, and the performance throttles significantly. The battery life has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

The NVIDIA GTX 860 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Battery drains incredibly fast, even on light tasks.. Looking to return it.",
