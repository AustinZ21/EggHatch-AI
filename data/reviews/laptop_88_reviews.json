The NVIDIA RTX 2070 is good, but I expected a bit more from the keyboard on the MSI GP Series GP65 Leopard 9SF-240 15.6\" 144 Hz IPS Intel Core i7 9th Gen 9750H (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 16 GB Memory 512 GB NVMe SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the MSI GP Series GP65 Leopard 9SF-240 15.6\" 144 Hz IPS Intel Core i7 9th Gen 9750H (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 16 GB Memory 512 GB NVMe SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
