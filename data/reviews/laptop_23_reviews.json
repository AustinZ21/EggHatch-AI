    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Fortnite, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Predator G9-593-71EH Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD (2 x 128 GB in Raid 0) 1 TB HDD 15.6\" Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Display with G-SYNC.

The NVIDIA GTX 1070 is good, but I expected a bit more from the speakers on the Acer Predator G9-593-71EH Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD (2 x 128 GB in Raid 0) 1 TB HDD 15.6\" Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Display with G-SYNC.

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the Acer Predator G9-593-71EH Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1070 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD (2 x 128 GB in Raid 0) 1 TB HDD 15.6\" Full HD (1920 x 1080) IPS Display with G-SYNC. It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Fortnite, and the performance throttles significantly. The keyboard has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
