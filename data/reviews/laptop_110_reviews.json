Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Predator Triton 500 PT515-51-7746 15.6\" 144 Hz IPS Intel Core i7 9th Gen 9750H (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 16 GB Memory 512 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA RTX 2070 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The screen developed dead pixels within a month.. Looking to return it.",
