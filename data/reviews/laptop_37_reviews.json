    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS ROG GL503VD-DB71 15.6\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 16 GB Memory 1 TB SSHD (8 GB SSD Cache) Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Performance in content creation and gaming is not as advertised. Regret this purchase.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the port selection on the ASUS ROG GL503VD-DB71 15.6\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 16 GB Memory 1 TB SSHD (8 GB SSD Cache) Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Good for competitive gaming, but the fan noise could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
