Good for streaming games, but the build material could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Lenovo Y520 80YY0090US 15.6'' FHD GTX 1060 6 GB VRAM i7-7700HQ 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home Gaming Laptop. The speakers is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
