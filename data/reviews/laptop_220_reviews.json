It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Call of Duty: Warzone, and the performance throttles significantly. The port selection has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The chassis feels surprisingly flimsy for the price.. Looking to return it.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is good, but I expected a bit more from the keyboard on the Acer A717-71G-707B 17.3\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
