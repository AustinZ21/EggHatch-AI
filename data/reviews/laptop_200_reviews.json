The keyboard is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the ASUS ROG STRIX SCAR GL703GM Gaming and Entertainment Laptop (Intel i7-8750H 6-Core, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 17.3\" Full HD (1920x1080), NVIDIA GTX 1060, Wifi, Bluetooth, Webcam, 4xUSB 3.1, Win 10 Home)!",

Good for competitive gaming, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with the initial setup taking longer than expected, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Apex Legends, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS ROG STRIX SCAR GL703GM Gaming and Entertainment Laptop (Intel i7-8750H 6-Core, 16GB RAM, 256GB SSD, 17.3\" Full HD (1920x1080), NVIDIA GTX 1060, Wifi, Bluetooth, Webcam, 4xUSB 3.1, Win 10 Home). The keyboard is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
