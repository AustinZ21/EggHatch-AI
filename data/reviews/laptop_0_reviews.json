    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Starfield, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the GIGABYTE AERO 15-X9-9RT4K5MP 15.6\" 4K/UHD IPS Intel Core i9 8th Gen 8950HK (2.90 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 32 GB Memory 1 TB SSD Windows 10 Pro 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The speakers is also top-notch.

Good for AAA gaming, but the build material could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
