    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Cyberpunk 2077, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Lenovo Legion Y520 80WK00FCUS 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 8 GB Memory 128 GB M.2 PCIe SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The screen brightness is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",
