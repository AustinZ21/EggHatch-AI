The NVIDIA RTX 2060 is good, but I expected a bit more from the speakers on the MSI GL Series GL63 8SE-209 15.6\" 120 Hz Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 16 GB Memory 256 GB NVMe SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the MSI GL Series GL63 8SE-209 15.6\" 120 Hz Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 16 GB Memory 256 GB NVMe SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop.
