    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS FX53VD-MS72 15.6\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 8 GB Memory 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The speakers is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Good for content creation and gaming, but the port selection could be better. Had a minor issue with the initial setup taking longer than expected, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the screen brightness on the ASUS FX53VD-MS72 15.6\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 8 GB Memory 256 GB M.2 SATA SSD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
