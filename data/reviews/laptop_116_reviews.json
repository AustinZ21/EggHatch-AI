Good for gaming, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS VivoBook Pro 17 Thin and Portable Laptop, 17.3\" Full HD, Intel Core i7-8565U, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050, 16 GB RAM, 1 TB HDD + 256 GB SSD, 802.11ac WiFi, USB-C, Backlit KB, Windows 10 - N705FD-ES76. The fan noise is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Valorant, and the performance throttles significantly. The port selection has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
