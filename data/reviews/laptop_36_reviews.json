Good for content creation and gaming, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Elden Ring, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS ROG GL503VD-DB74 15.6\" Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The keyboard is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
