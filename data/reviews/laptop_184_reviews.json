    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the 2019 Legion Y540 15.6\" FHD IPS Gaming Laptop, 9th Gen Intel 6-Core i7-9750H Upto 4.5GHz, 8GB RAM, 500GB HDD, NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 4GB, Backlit Keyboard, USB-C, Windows 10. It overheats frequently when playing Starfield, and the performance throttles significantly. The screen brightness has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

Wi-Fi drops intermittently and the speakers feels cheap. Performance in content creation and gaming is not as advertised. Regret this purchase.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1650 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",
