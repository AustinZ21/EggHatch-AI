The fan noise is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the ASUS FX505DY-ES51 15.6\" 60 Hz AMD Ryzen 5 3550H (2.10 GHz) AMD Radeon RX 560X 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop!",

The display quality is good, but I expected a bit more from the trackpad on the ASUS FX505DY-ES51 15.6\" 60 Hz AMD Ryzen 5 3550H (2.10 GHz) AMD Radeon RX 560X 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Good for AAA gaming, but the battery life could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
