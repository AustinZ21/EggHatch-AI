The NVIDIA GTX 1650 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The chassis feels surprisingly flimsy for the price.. Looking to return it.",

It Wi-Fi drops intermittently frequently when playing Elden Ring, and the performance throttles significantly. The port selection has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
