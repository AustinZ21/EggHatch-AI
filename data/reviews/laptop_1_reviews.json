The NVIDIA GTX 860 is good, but I expected a bit more from the trackpad on the Lenovo Y50 Touch (59426255) 15.6\" Intel Core i7 4th Gen 4700HQ (2.40 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 8 GB Memory 8 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

Good for content creation and gaming, but the build material could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Lenovo Y50 Touch (59426255) 15.6\" Intel Core i7 4th Gen 4700HQ (2.40 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 8 GB Memory 8 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The battery life is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the Lenovo Y50 Touch (59426255) 15.6\" Intel Core i7 4th Gen 4700HQ (2.40 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 860M 8 GB Memory 8 GB SSD 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. It Wi-Fi drops intermittently frequently when playing Apex Legends, and the performance throttles significantly. The port selection has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
