The NVIDIA RTX 2070 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Battery drains incredibly fast, even on light tasks.. Looking to return it.",

Good for streaming games, but the screen brightness could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
