The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the port selection on the ASUS VivoBook Pro 17 N705UD-EH76 17.3\" Thin and Portable FHD Laptop, GTX 1050, Intel Core i7-8550U 1.80 GHz Processor, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, USB-C, Backlit Keyboard. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Starfield, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS VivoBook Pro 17 N705UD-EH76 17.3\" Thin and Portable FHD Laptop, GTX 1050, Intel Core i7-8550U 1.80 GHz Processor, 16 GB DDR4 RAM, 256 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD, 802.11ac Wi-Fi, USB-C, Backlit Keyboard. The port selection is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
