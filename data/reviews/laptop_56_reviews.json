The screen brightness is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the ASUS ROG Strix Hero Edition 15.6\" Gaming Laptop, 8th-Gen Intel Core i5-8300H Processor (Up to 3.9 GHz), GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB, 120 Hz 3 ms Display, 8 GB DDR4, 128 GB PCIe SSD + 1 TB SSHD, RGB KB!",

Good for streaming games, but the keyboard could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the port selection on the ASUS ROG Strix Hero Edition 15.6\" Gaming Laptop, 8th-Gen Intel Core i5-8300H Processor (Up to 3.9 GHz), GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 4 GB, 120 Hz 3 ms Display, 8 GB DDR4, 128 GB PCIe SSD + 1 TB SSHD, RGB KB. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
