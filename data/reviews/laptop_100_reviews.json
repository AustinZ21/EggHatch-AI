Good for streaming games, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

Performance is good for most games like Elden Ring, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-51-757A 15.6\" 144 Hz IPS GTX 1060 6 GB VRAM i7-8750H 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home Gaming Laptop. The battery life is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",
