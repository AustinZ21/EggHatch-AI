    "text": "Absolutely love this laptop! The performance for competitive gaming is incredible, especially the NVIDIA GTX 1050. Boots up super fast and handles everything I throw at it. The fan noise is also top-notch. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a beast like the Lenovo Legion Y520 (80WK00HSUS) 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop!",

    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Call of Duty: Warzone, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Lenovo Legion Y520 (80WK00HSUS) 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i7 7th Gen 7700HQ (2.80 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop. The port selection is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Good for competitive gaming, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with the initial setup taking longer than expected, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
