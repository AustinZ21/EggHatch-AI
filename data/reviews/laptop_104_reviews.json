Performance is good for most games like Apex Legends, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the Refurbished: Acer Nitro 5 AN515-51-504A 15.6\" IPS Intel Core i5 7th Gen 7300HQ (2.50 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1050 Ti 16 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-Bit Gaming Laptop.

Good for AAA gaming, but the fan noise could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
