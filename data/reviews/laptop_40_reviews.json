    "text": "It's a decent gaming laptop for the money. Performance is good for most games like Starfield, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS K570UD-ES54 15.6\" FHD GeForce GTX 1050 Core i5-8250U 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home Gaming Laptop With Fingerprint Reader and Backlit Keyboard. The battery life is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

It overheats frequently when playing Cyberpunk 2077, and the performance throttles significantly. The trackpad has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",
