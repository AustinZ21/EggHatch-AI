Performance is good for most games like Elden Ring, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS FX504GD-NH51 15.6\" IPS GTX 1050 Intel 8th Gen i5-8300H (2.30 GHz) 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop -- ONLY @ NEWEGG. The trackpad is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Good for streaming games, but the trackpad could be better. Had a minor issue with bloatware, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",

    "text": "An average performer. The NVIDIA GTX 1050 is good, but I expected a bit more from the speakers on the ASUS FX504GD-NH51 15.6\" IPS GTX 1050 Intel 8th Gen i5-8300H (2.30 GHz) 8 GB Memory 256 GB SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop -- ONLY @ NEWEGG. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
