Performance is good for most games like Cyberpunk 2077, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the ASUS N550JX-DS71T 15.6\" IPS 4th Generation Intel Core i7 4720HQ (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Laptop. The port selection is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

The NVIDIA GTX 950 is good, but I expected a bit more from the trackpad on the ASUS N550JX-DS71T 15.6\" IPS 4th Generation Intel Core i7 4720HQ (2.60 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce GTX 950M 8 GB Memory 1 TB HDD Windows 8.1 64-Bit Laptop. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
