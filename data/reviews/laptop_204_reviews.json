Wi-Fi drops intermittently and the keyboard feels cheap. Performance in streaming games is not as advertised. Regret this purchase.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1060 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. Fans get extremely loud, like a jet engine.. Looking to return it.",

    "text": "Quite disappointed with this laptop, the Lenovo LEGION Y520 Gaming and Business Laptop (Intel i7-7700HQ Quad Core, 16GB RAM, 512GB PCIe SSD, 15.6\" Full HD (1920 x 1080), GeForce GTX 1060 6GB, Backlit Keyboard, Win 10 Home). It overheats frequently when playing Cyberpunk 2077, and the performance throttles significantly. The speakers has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",
