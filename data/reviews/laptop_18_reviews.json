The NVIDIA GTX 1070 in the ASUS ROG Strix Scar Edition 17.3\" Gaming Laptop, 8th-Gen 6-Core Intel Core i7-8750H Processor (Up to 3.9 GHz), GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB, 144 Hz 3 ms Display, 16 GB DDR4, 256 GB PCIe SSD + 1 TB SSHD is a powerhouse. Battery life is decent for a gaming laptop too. Very satisfied with this purchase.",

It performance throttles under load frequently when playing Cyberpunk 2077, and the performance throttles significantly. The trackpad has been a letdown. Wouldn't recommend.",

The NVIDIA GTX 1070 is good, but I expected a bit more from the screen brightness on the ASUS ROG Strix Scar Edition 17.3\" Gaming Laptop, 8th-Gen 6-Core Intel Core i7-8750H Processor (Up to 3.9 GHz), GeForce GTX 1070 8 GB, 144 Hz 3 ms Display, 16 GB DDR4, 256 GB PCIe SSD + 1 TB SSHD. It's a fair choice if you can get it on a good deal.",
