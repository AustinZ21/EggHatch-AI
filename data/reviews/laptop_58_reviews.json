The NVIDIA RTX 2060 is okay, but the cons outweigh the pros. The screen developed dead pixels within a month.. Looking to return it.",

Performance is good for most games like Valorant, but it can struggle a bit with the newest AAA titles on ultra settings with the MSI GL Series GL73 8SE-028 17.3\" 120 Hz Intel Core i5 8th Gen 8300H (2.30 GHz) NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 16 GB Memory 256 GB NVMe SSD Windows 10 Home 64-bit Gaming Laptop. The trackpad is okay, not great. Overall, it gets the job done.",

Good for AAA gaming, but the keyboard could be better. Had a minor issue with driver updates being a bit tricky, but it was resolved. Solid, but not spectacular.",
